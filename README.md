## About

I’m an **AI Engineer** focused on building **practical, system-oriented AI applications**.

My learning approach is hands-on: I reverse-engineer real-world architectures, work through data and failure cases, and design pipelines that behave predictably outside of notebooks.

I care about:
- clear data flow  
- observable system behavior  
- correctness over cleverness  

Currently preparing for an **entry-level AI engineering role**.

---

## Technical Focus

**Programming & Data**
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas
- Data preprocessing & transformation

**Machine Learning**
- Classical ML fundamentals
- Embeddings & vector similarity
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**Systems & Tooling**
- FAISS
- Structured project layouts (`src/`)
- Git, PyCharm, Jupyter

---

## Selected Projects

### **BookFriend**
*Semantic Search & AI Reading Companion*

BookFriend is a production-style AI system that enables semantic search over book content using vector embeddings.

**What I built**
- Embedding generation and storage pipeline
- FAISS-based similarity search
- Persistent vector index with metadata mapping
- Clean `src/` architecture designed for extensibility

**Why it matters**
This project taught me how retrieval systems behave at scale, how embedding quality affects results, and how to design AI components as **systems**, not scripts.

**Tech:** Python · FAISS · Embeddings · Data Pipelines

---

### **FaceSense**
*End-to-End Facial Emotion Recognition System*

FaceSense is a computer vision pipeline for real-time facial emotion analysis with structured logging.

**What I built**
- Real-time face detection and emotion inference
- Emotion telemetry logging for downstream analysis
- Pipeline-style design rather than a single-file demo

**Why it matters**
This project pushed me beyond “model output” into thinking about inference stability, data collection, and system behavior in real conditions.

**Tech:** Python · OpenCV · Deep Learning · Data Logging

## Current Learning Direction

- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Embedding evaluation and failure cases
- Designing AI systems that degrade gracefully
- Writing cleaner, more testable Python
